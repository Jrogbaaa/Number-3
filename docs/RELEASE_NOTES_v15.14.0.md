Personalized recommendations tailored to each user:

- **Industry-Specific Strategies**: Customized messaging advice for user's target industries
- **Timing Optimization**: Guidance on using the outreach calendar effectively

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **Component**: `ScoringTutorialModal.tsx` - Main tutorial interface with personalization engine
- **Hook**: `useScoringTutorial.ts` - State management and intelligent triggering logic
- **Integration**: Dashboard and Data Input pages with smart timing controls
- **Persistence**: localStorage-based completion tracking with reset detection

#### Personalization Engine
```typescript
// Dynamic content generation based on user preferences
const getPersonalizedContent = (userPreferences) => {
  const companyName = userPreferences?.companyInfo?.name || 'your company';
  const targetRoles = userPreferences?.targetRoles || [];
  const targetIndustries = userPreferences?.targetIndustries || [];
  
  // Generate company-specific explanations and examples
  return personalizedContent;
};
```

#### Intelligent Triggering
- **Upload Success**: Triggers 1 second after successful uploads for new users
- **Settings Reset**: Triggers 2.5 seconds after dashboard loads following reset
- **Condition Checking**: Verifies authentication, onboarding completion, and preference loading
- **Reset Detection**: 60-second window to detect recent settings resets

#### State Management
```typescript
interface ScoringTutorialState {
  hasSeenTutorial: boolean;
  showTutorial: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

// localStorage persistence
const TUTORIAL_STORAGE_KEY = 'scoring-tutorial-completed';
```
