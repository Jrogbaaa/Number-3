# Release Notes - Version 15.13.0

## 🎯 Critical Bug Fixes

### Lead Scoring Consistency Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: Users reported that leads appeared in different orders each time they navigated away from the dashboard and returned. This was causing confusion and making it difficult to track high-priority leads.

**Root Cause**: The application was running two separate scoring systems:
1. Dashboard scoring during data fetch (sometimes without user preferences loaded)
2. LeadsTable scoring during display (with different preference states)

This created race conditions where leads could be scored differently depending on timing.

**Solution**: 
- **Unified Scoring System**: Removed duplicate scoring in Dashboard component
- **Deterministic Calculations**: Replaced all `Math.random()` calls with hash-based deterministic functions
- **Enhanced Caching**: Cache keys now include preference state to ensure consistency
- **Stable Sorting**: Added final tie-breakers for identical scores

**Impact**: Leads now maintain consistent ordering across all user interactions, page refreshes, and navigation.

### Outreach Message Formatting Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem**: AI-generated outreach messages were showing prefixes like "Here is the transformed message:" at the beginning of messages, making them look unprofessional.

**Root Cause**: The AI response cleaning system wasn't comprehensive enough to handle all variations of AI response prefixes.

**Solution**:
- **Advanced Prefix Removal**: Comprehensive list of common AI response prefixes
- **Iterative Cleaning**: Multiple cleaning passes to handle nested responses
- **Company Signature Enhancement**: Automatic inclusion of company names in signatures
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Improved detection of prefix variations

**Impact**: All outreach messages now appear clean and professional without AI artifacts.
