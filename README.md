## CSV Upload Guidelines

The platform supports CSV file uploads with flexible data handling:

### Supported Column Names

The system automatically recognizes various common column names for core fields:

- **Name**: `name`, `Name`, `contact`, `Contact`
- **Email**: `email`, `Email`, `E-mail`, `e_mail`
- **Company**: `company`, `Company`, `organization`, `Organization`
- **Title**: `title`, `Title`, `position`, `Position`
- **Source**: `source`, `Source`, `channel`, `Channel`
- **Value**: `value`, `Value` (Used in Budget Potential calculation)
- **Location**: `location`, `Location`, `city`, `City`, `state`, `State`, `country`, `Country`
- **Phone**: `phone`, `Phone`, `mobile`, `Mobile`
- **LinkedIn URL**: `linkedin`, `LinkedIn`, `linkedinUrl`, `linkedin_url`
- **Tags**: `tags`, `Tags` (Comma-separated values expected)

*Note: The scoring system will attempt to infer information even if specific columns like `insights` are not present.* 

### Requirements

- CSV file must have headers (column names in the first row)
- File should be UTF-8 encoded
- No file size limit - large files are automatically processed in batches

### Data Processing

- All data rows will be processed
- Data is processed in batches for handling files of any size
- **Robust Parsing**: Improved error handling and delimiter detection for CSV uploads.
- Duplicate records are handled based on email uniqueness
- Contact scores (Marketing, Budget, Orientation) are automatically calculated upon retrieval
- **Automatic Enrichment**: Location, timezone, and optimal outreach times are determined during processing.

## Contact Scoring Model

The platform utilizes a multi-dimensional scoring system (0-100 where applicable) to analyze contacts based on available CSV data:

### 1. Marketing Activity Score (0-100)
- **Purpose**: Identifies contacts with a strong focus on marketing roles or activities.
- **Factors**: Analyzes job titles (prioritizing marketing leadership & specific roles), company/industry type (agencies, media), lead source, keywords in insights/notes, and relevant tags.

### 2. Budget Potential (0-100) & Confidence (Low/Medium/High)
- **Purpose**: Estimates the potential budget associated with a contact.
- **Factors**: Analyzes role seniority (leadership, director, manager), provided `value` field, inferred company size/type (enterprise vs startup), industry indicators (finance, tech), location (financial hubs), and relevant tags or insights notes mentioning budget/funding.
- **Confidence**: Indicates the reliability of the estimate based on the quality and directness of the available data points (e.g., known `value` and seniority increase confidence).

### 3. Business Orientation (B2B/B2C/Mixed/Unknown) & Confidence (Low/Medium/High)
- **Purpose**: Classifies the contact's likely business focus.
- **Factors**: Analyzes email domain (business vs personal), company name indicators (keywords like `inc`, `retail`, `solutions`), job title keywords (sales vs customer service), lead source, and relevant tags.
- **Confidence**: Indicates the certainty of the classification based on the strength and consistency of the signals.

The dashboard table displays these scores and classifications, allowing for sorting and filtering to prioritize contacts based on specific criteria.

## User Interface Highlights

The platform features a carefully designed UI, recently refined for enhanced clarity, consistency, and professionalism:

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with data uploads or database functionality, the application includes a built-in diagnostic tool:

1. Navigate to `/debug` in your browser
2. The diagnostics page will:
   - Test your Supabase connection
   - Verify the leads table structure
   - Provide tools to download sample data
   - Allow you to clear all leads if needed

### Data Management

#### Clearing All Leads
You can clear all leads from two locations:
1. **Dashboard** - Use the red "Clear All Leads" button in the top navigation
2. **Debug Page** (`/debug`) - Use the "Clear All Leads" button in the Data Management section

If you encounter issues clearing leads:
- Make sure your Supabase connection is working (check the Debug page)
- Verify you have proper RLS policies in your Supabase project that allow deletes
- Try clearing in smaller batches by uploading fewer leads at a time

#### Refreshing Data
If you see stale data or need to refresh:
1. Use the "Refresh Data" button on the Dashboard
2. This forces a full reload from the database, bypassing any cached data

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### CSV Upload Failures
- Ensure your CSV file is properly formatted with headers
- Check that your file is UTF-8 encoded
- Try uploading smaller batches if experiencing timeout issues
- Try the sample CSV template available at `/sample-leads.csv`

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your Supabase URL and anon key are correct in the environment variables
- Check if your Supabase project is active and not paused
- Ensure your database has the required 'leads' table (use the Debug page)
- Check browser console for specific error messages

#### Permission Issues
- The application uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- If you can't add, modify or delete leads, check your RLS policies
- For testing, you can temporarily enable full access by configuring your RLS policy to return true

#### Data Not Displaying After Upload
- Use the "Refresh Data" button on the dashboard
- Check the browser console for any API errors
- Verify the data was successfully uploaded via the Supabase Table Editor
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading the page

#### Lead Upload Issues (Recent Fix - December 2024)
**Problem**: Leads uploaded but not appearing in dashboard
**Solution**: This was a critical issue that has been resolved in the latest update. If you experience this:
1. Make sure you're signed in with Google OAuth before uploading leads
2. The system now properly routes authenticated users to database storage instead of localStorage
3. Clear your browser's localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
4. Refresh the page and try uploading again
5. Check that the upload success message indicates database storage, not localStorage

**Technical Details**: Previous versions incorrectly used `allowUnauthenticated={true}` on the data-input page, causing all uploads to go to localStorage regardless of authentication status. This has been fixed to use `allowUnauthenticated={!isAuthenticated}`.

#### Mobile Compatibility Issues
- Clear browser cache and reload if CSS doesn't appear correct
- Make sure you're using the latest version of your mobile browser
- Check that JavaScript is enabled on your mobile browser
- Some advanced features may have reduced functionality on older mobile devices 

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and prevent regressions:

### Unit and Integration Tests (Jest)

We use Jest for testing individual components, utility functions, and API routes:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Playwright is used for end-to-end testing to ensure the application works correctly from a user's perspective:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI mode (for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Install Playwright browsers (first-time setup)
npx playwright install
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Core functionality (message generation, data upload/processing)
- API routes (handling requests, data validation, error cases)
- UI components (rendering, user interactions)
- End-to-end user flows (complete scenarios from upload to message customization)

### Test Structure
- `src/__tests__/` - Jest unit and integration tests
- `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end tests 

## Authentication Setup

The platform uses NextAuth.js for authentication with Google OAuth:

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
5. Set the application type to "Web application"
6. Add your authorized JavaScript origins:
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - For production: Your production domain
7. Add your authorized redirect URIs:
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - For production: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`
8. Click "Create" and note your Client ID and Client Secret
9. Add these credentials to your `.env` file as described in the installation section

### Required Permissions

1. **Google Cloud IAM Roles**:
   - No special IAM roles are needed for basic OAuth functionality
   - The OAuth client needs the "Google Sign-In" API enabled in the Google Cloud Console

2. **Supabase Permissions**:
   - The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is required for the NextAuth adapter to create and manage user records
   - Ensure your Supabase database has appropriate tables for NextAuth (created by the migration script)
   - Make sure Row Level Security (RLS) policies allow the service role to manage auth-related tables

### User Management

- New users are automatically created in the database when they sign in with Google
- User sessions are maintained using JWT tokens
- Authentication state is accessible throughout the application via the NextAuth session provider
